## Configuration
### RTC module
 
Compile the RTC program:
`cc rtc-pi.c -o rtc-pi`

Set the time (replace time format by actual date/time):
`sudo ./rtc-pi YYYYMMDDhhmmss`

A RTC module would be useless on the PI without using it to retrieve the right clock at the right time. And the PI needs a clock the most at boot.

To read a valid clock from the module we require it to have the correct time set beforehand. For this we can use the same binary to save the correct time (obtained most likely via NTP) on a previous shutdown.

For this, create a new file (letâ€™s call it **savetime**) in **/etc/init.d** with the following content:

```
#!/bin/bash
# saving date/time to RTC module
/usr/sbin/rtc-pi `date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S"`
```

And make it executable
`sudo chmod a+x /etc/init.d/savetime`

Then symlink this file in **/etc/rc0.d**
`ln -s /etc/init.d/savetime /etc/rc0.d/K01savetime`

**rc0.d** is the folder for scripts called at runlevel 0 (shutdown/restart)

### Set the main script in place
Put the **BoredTimes** script in `/home/pi/Scripts/boredtimes/`

### Install Astral
`sudo pip install astral`

### Executing time and GPIO pins script at boot

```
sudo cp startup /etc/init.d/startup
sudo chmod a+x /etc/init.d/startup
sudo insserv /etc/init.d/startup
```

## Testing

### RTC
Test if the RTC contains the right date/time:
`sudo ./rtc-pi`

### Relay
Using the relay via the **/sys** filesystem

View the current state of GPIO 22:
`cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio122/value`

Set the state of GPIO 22 by writing `1` for high (relay on) and `0` for low (relay off):
```
echo "1" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio22/value
echo "0" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio22/value
```
